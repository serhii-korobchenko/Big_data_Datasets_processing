Systematic review of the published literature. Out-patient clinics, emergency departments and hospitalisation wards in 23 health centres from 10 countries. Cohort studies reporting the frequency of hypoxaemia in children under 5 years of age with ALRI, and the association between hypoxaemia and the risk of dying. Prevalence of hypoxaemia measured in children with ARI and relative risks for the association between the severity of illness and the frequency of hypoxaemia, and between hypoxaemia and the risk of dying. Seventeen published studies were found that included 4,021 children under 5 with acute respiratory infections (ARI) and reported the prevalence of hypoxaemia. Out-patient children and those with a clinical diagnosis of upper ARI had a low risk of hypoxaemia (pooled estimate of 6% to 9%). The prevalence increased to 31% and to 43% in patients in emergency departments and in cases with clinical pneumonia, respectively, and it was even higher among hospitalised children (47%) and in those with radiographically confirmed pneumonia (72%).

Three papers reported an association between hypoxaemia and death, with relative risks varying between 1.4 and 4.6. Papers describing predictors of hypoxaemia have focused on clinical signs for detecting hypoxaemia rather than on identifying risk factors for developing this complication. Hypoxaemia is a common and potentially lethal complication of ALRI in children under 5, particularly among those with severe disease and those living at high altitude. Given the observed high prevalence of hypoxaemia and its likely association with increased mortality, efforts should be made to improve the detection of hypoxaemia and to provide oxygen earlier to more children with severe ALRI.'}"

       " 'text': 'Epidemiology of hypoxaemia in children with acute lower respiratory infection.\\nTo determine the prevalence of hypoxaemia in children aged under 5 years suffering acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI), the risk factors for hypoxaemia in children under 5 years of age with ALRI, and the association of hypoxaemia with an increased risk of dying in children of the same age. Systematic review of the published literature. Out-patient clinics, emergency departments and hospitalisation wards in 23 health centres from 10 countries. Cohort studies reporting the frequency of hypoxaemia in children under 5 years of age with ALRI, and the association between hypoxaemia and the risk of dying. Prevalence of hypoxaemia measured in children with ARI and relative risks for the association between the severity of illness and the frequency of hypoxaemia, and between hypoxaemia and the risk of dying. Seventeen published studies were found that included 4,021 children under 5 with acute respiratory infections (ARI) and reported the prevalence of hypoxaemia. Out-patient children and those with a clinical diagnosis of upper ARI had a low risk of hypoxaemia (pooled estimate of 6% to 9%). The prevalence increased to 31% and to 43% in patients in emergency departments and in cases with clinical pneumonia, respectively, and it was even higher among hospitalised children (47%) and in those with radiographically confirmed pneumonia (72%). The cumulated data also suggest that hypoxaemia is more frequent in children living at high altitude. Three papers reported an association between hypoxaemia and death, with relative risks varying between 1.4 and 4.6. Papers describing predictors of hypoxaemia have focused on clinical signs for detecting hypoxaemia rather than on identifying risk factors for developing this complication. Hypoxaemia is a common and potentially lethal complication of ALRI in children under 5, particularly among those with severe disease and those living at high altitude. Given the observed high prevalence of hypoxaemia and its likely association with increased mortality, efforts should be made to improve the detection of hypoxaemia and to provide oxygen earlier to more children with severe ALRI.',\n",

       " 'text': 'Randomized study of dose or schedule modification of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in platinum-based chemotherapy for elderly patients with lung cancer.\\nIt is generally believed that elderly patients are less able to tolerate aggressive cancer chemotherapy than their younger counterparts. Bone marrow cellularity diminishes with age and elderly patients may have decreased tolerance to myelosuppressive agents. Between November 1995 and October 1999, 68 chemotherapy-naive elderly (70 or more years old) patients with histologically or cytologically proven lung cancer who were to receive platinum-based chemotherapy were enrolled in this study. All patients had adequate cardiac, hematological, liver and renal function to receive chemotherapy. Patients were randomized into 3 groups. Patients in groups 1 and 2 received 2 microg/kg and 4 microg/kg granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF, lenograstim), respectively, when grade 3 leukopenia (<2,000/microl) or neutropenia (<1,000/microl) appeared after chemotherapy. Patients in group 3 received 2 microg/kg G-CSF when grade 2 leukopenia (<3,000/microl) or neutropenia (<1,500/microl) appeared after chemotherapy. G-CSF was stopped in all groups when the leukocyte count increased to over 10,000/microl or the neutrophil count exceeded 5,000/microl. Full blood cell counts were examined 3 times a week after chemotherapy. All patients received platinum-based chemotherapy. Eighteen, 16 and 22 patients (78%, 73% and 96%) in groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively, received G-CSF when leukopenia or neutropenia appeared. The durations of G-CSF treatment required by groups 1 and 3 (5.7+/-3.6 and 6.6+/-3.2 days, respectively) did not differ significantly, but the duration of treatment required by group 2 (3.7+/-2.8 days) was significantly shorter than that of group 1 (p=0.048). The duration of grade 4 neutropenia in group 2 (0.7+/-1.1 days) was marginally shorter than that in group 1 (1.6+/-2.1 days, p=0.076). The neutrophil nadir of group 2 (949+/-757/microl) was marginally higher than that of group 1 (592+/-438/microl, p=0.058). No patients in group 2 experienced grade 4 neutropenia for 4 days or more or a neutrophil nadir less than 100/microl a significant difference from group 1, where 22% and 17% of patients experienced these events (p=0.02 and p=0.04, respectively). Similarly, no infections requiring antibiotics after chemotherapy occurred in patients in group 2, a significant difference from group 1 (26%, p=0.01). The rates of neutropenia and infection in groups 1 and 3 did not differ significantly. The peak plasma concentration of G-CSF in group 2 was significantly higher than in group 1 (p=0.0018), but did not differ significantly between groups 1 and 3. Doubling the dose of G-CSF could help to decrease neutropenia and prevent infection after chemotherapy in elderly patients with lung cancer.'}"

       "  'text': 'Epidemiology of hypoxaemia in children with acute lower respiratory infection.\\nTo determine the prevalence of hypoxaemia in children aged under 5 years suffering acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI), the risk factors for hypoxaemia in children under 5 years of age with ALRI, and the association of hypoxaemia with an increased risk of dying in children of the same age. Systematic review of the published literature. Out-patient clinics, emergency departments and hospitalisation wards in 23 health centres from 10 countries. Cohort studies reporting the frequency of hypoxaemia in children under 5 years of age with ALRI, and the association between hypoxaemia and the risk of dying. Prevalence of hypoxaemia measured in children with ARI and relative risks for the association between the severity of illness and the frequency of hypoxaemia, and between hypoxaemia and the risk of dying. Seventeen published studies were found that included 4,021 children under 5 with acute respiratory infections (ARI) and reported the prevalence of hypoxaemia. Out-patient children and those with a clinical diagnosis of upper ARI had a low risk of hypoxaemia (pooled estimate of 6% to 9%). The prevalence increased to 31% and to 43% in patients in emergency departments and in cases with clinical pneumonia, respectively, and it was even higher among hospitalised children (47%) and in those with radiographically confirmed pneumonia (72%). The cumulated data also suggest that hypoxaemia is more frequent in children living at high altitude. Three papers reported an association between hypoxaemia and death, with relative risks varying between 1.4 and 4.6. Papers describing predictors of hypoxaemia have focused on clinical signs for detecting hypoxaemia rather than on identifying risk factors for developing this complication. Hypoxaemia is a common and potentially lethal complication of ALRI in children under 5, particularly among those with severe disease and those living at high altitude. Given the observed high prevalence of hypoxaemia and its likely association with increased mortality, efforts should be made to improve the detection of hypoxaemia and to provide oxygen earlier to more children with severe ALRI.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'Clinical signs of hypoxaemia in children with acute lower respiratory infection: indicators of oxygen therapy.\\nHypoxaemia is a common complication of acute lower respiratory tract infections in children. In most developing countries, where the majority of deaths from pneumonia occur, facilities for early detection of hypoxaemia are lacking and oxygen is in short supply. This review examines the usefulness of different clinical signs and symptoms in the prediction of hypoxaemia associated with acute respiratory infections in children. Several respiratory signs were found to be associated with hypoxaemia. These include very fast breathing (with a respiratory rate of more than 60 or 70 breaths per minute), cyanosis, grunting, nasal flaring, chest retractions, head nodding and auscultatory signs, as well as signs of general depression of the child, such as inability to feed or lethargy. The sensitivity and specificity of these signs, as described in the reviewed studies, is presented, and combination rules are discussed. Through appropriate combination of several physical signs, which can be used by peripheral health workers and be taught to mothers, it is possible to predict hypoxaemia in children with acute respiratory tract infections with reasonable accuracy.'},\n",

Prospective evaluation of children with severe or very severe pneumonia. SpO2 was measured at the time of presentation and every day until hypoxaemia resolved. Children with a SpO2 less than 85% received supplemental oxygen. By comparing with a retrospective control group for whom oxygen administration was guided by clinical signs, we evaluated whether there was a survival advantage from using a protocol for the administration of oxygen based on pulse oximetry. We determined normal values for oxygen saturation in children living in the highlands. In 151 well, normal highland children, the mean SpO2 was 95.7% (SD 2.7%). The median SpO2 among children with severe or very severe pneumonia was 70% (56-77); 376 (53.5%) had moderate hypoxaemia (SpO2 70-84%); 202 (28.7%) had severe hypoxaemia (SpO2 50-69%); and 125 (17.8%) had very severe hypoxaemia (SpO2 < 50%). Longer duration of cough or the presence of hepatomegaly or cyanosis predicted more severe degrees of hypoxaemia. After 10, 20 and 30 days from the beginning of treatment, respectively 102 (14.5%), 38 (5.4%) and 19 (2.7%) of children had persistent hypoxaemia; 46 children (6.5%) died. Predictors of death were low SpO2 on presentation, severe malnutrition, measles and history of cough for more than 7 days. The mortality risk ratio between the 703 children managed whose oxygen administration was guided by the use of pulse oximetry and the retrospective control group who received supplemental oxygen based on clinical signs was 0.65 (95%CI 0.41-1.02, two-sided Fisher's exact test, P = 0.07). There is a need to increase the availability of supplemental oxygen in smaller health facilities in developing countries, and to train health workers to recognise the clinical signs and risk factors for hypoxaemia. In moderate sized hospitals a protocol for the administration of oxygen based on pulse oximetry may improve survival.\"},\n",

However, in some rural African settings without regular electricity and with logistical problems in the transport of oxygen cylinders, the delivery of oxygen can be difficult. This paper compares the costs incurred using oxygen cylinders with a solar operated oxygen concentrator in a rural Gambian setting. The paper shows that a solar operated system has a high capital investment initially, but that running costs and maintenance are minimal. The system becomes cost effective if a rural hospital needs more than 6 treatment days (1 l/min) of oxygen per month and can be considered in a setting where 6 hours of sunlight per day can be guaranteed.'}]"
